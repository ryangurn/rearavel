# rearavel
i am going to use this opportunity to utilize multiple technologies that support great web apps. i am using laravel as the framework for the backend, i enjoy php however i do not want to be restricted by some mainly prebuild cms (ie: wordpress, drupal, ...). i want to get more comfortable with client side ui frameworks, and i have chosen to react as the one. i am working going to build an intuitive website for personal use that will utilize various complex methodologies for both laravel and react. i am not a huge UX person, so i have also chosen to use semantic-ui as the foundation for front end design, the goal is not to work excessively hard on designing the site so much as being comfortable with laravel and react. 

# goals
- develop a personal website that is a flexible framework for developers to build simple and customizable websites.
- utilize advanced techniques from both laravel and react to create a wonderful user experience.
- develop an application that is tightly coupled and cohesive in nature while providing extendability.
- integrate security into the SDLC and ensure that the resultant code conforms. 

## roadmap

### tasks
- [x] find useful coding standards for react and laravel
- [x] setup ci system to ensure automatic testing of the codebase automatically. 
- [ ] develop clear feature set for the project and lay out the documentation 
- [ ] go into excruciating detail as to how features get implemented.

### first steps
1. develop a clear first feature set 
2. setup testing infrastructure for sets of automatic feature and unit tests.
3. build up documentation for intended functionality. 

### coding
this project will attempt to follow the [psr-12: extended coding style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) guide, as linked for the php code that is included. in addition, [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) coding standard will be followed for react and any other js code that will be included in the codebase. 

### feature set
- [ ] a flexible homepage that allows for easy but structured modification
- [ ] a resume page that has predefined sections for information related to computer science hiring
- [ ] an education section that allows for the highlighting of academic accolades. 
- [ ] a project section for linking other websites/repositories as well as a platform for including new projects within this framework.
