# rearavel
I am going to use this opportunity to utilize multiple technologies that support great web apps. I am using laravel as the framework for the backend, I enjoy PHP however I do not want to be restricted by some mainly prebuild CMS (ie: wordpress, drupal, ...). I want to get more comfortable with client side UI frameworks, and I have chosen to react as the one. I am working going to build an intuitive website for personal use that will utilize various complex methodologies for both laravel and react. I am not a huge UX person, so I have also chosen to use SemanticUI as the foundation for front end design, the goal is not to work excessively hard on designing the site so much as being comfortable with laravel and react. 

# goals
- Develop a personal website that is a flexible framework for developers to build simple and customizable websites.
- Utilize advanced techniques from both laravel and react to create a wonderful user experience.
- Develop an application that is tightly coupled and cohesive in nature while providing extendability.
- Integrate security into the SDLC and ensure that the resultant code conforms. 

## roadmap

### Tasks
- [x] Find useful coding standards for react and laravel
- [ ] Develop clear feature set for the project and lay out the documentation 

### first steps
1. Develop a clear first feature set 
2. Setup testing infrastructure for sets of automatic feature and unit tests.
3. Build up documentation for intended functionality. 

#### coding
This project will attempt to follow the [psr-12: extended coding style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) guide, as linked for the PHP code that is included. In addition, [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) coding standard will be followed for React and any other JS code that will be included in the codebase.
