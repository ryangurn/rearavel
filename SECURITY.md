## Reporting a Vulnerability

When there is a need to report a vulnerability, please submit an issue in this repo to notify @ryangurnick
of the issue. Generally there will be automatic actions setup with feature and unit tests to check for many
vulnerabilities, please ensure that you have checked those results as well before reporting the issue, as 
it might be something that is currently in testing.

There is an issue template for reporting a security vulnerability so please utilize it and follow it religiously. 

Dependabot will also notify @ryangurnick when there are known vulnerabilities to patch, so please check there too.
